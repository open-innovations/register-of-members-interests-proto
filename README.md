# Competency Anserability Dashboard

This is the documentation for the Competency Answerability Dashboard prototype
tool created by Open Innovations on behalf of the UK Parliamentary Digital
Services.

Using [the published version of the tool](https://open-innovations.github.io/register-of-members-interests-proto/)
you can explore whether or not given competencies are answerable given the
current and potential future designs of the Register(s) of Members' Financial
Interests.

> **Please Note**
>
> The tool does not actually query the data contained in the registers. It has been designed to allow the impact of changes to the structure and content of the registers to be modelled. This can then be used to provide evidence of potential impact by those proposing changes to the registers.
