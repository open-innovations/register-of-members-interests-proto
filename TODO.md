# Plans

- [x] Create page per state - minimises the client-side javascript
- [x] Add 'answerable' state for each block based on a state / feature /
      dependency matrix
- [ ] Start to map out the current state - describe features that are currently
      in the questionnaire

## Potential future stuff

- [ ] The ability to specify the quality of a feature (0% - 50% - 100%) to allow
      competencies to be answered 'in part'.
- [ ] Dynamic state / state builder
