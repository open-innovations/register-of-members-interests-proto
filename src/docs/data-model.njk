<h2>Data model</h2>

<p>
    This site is based on augmentation of the list of competencies defined in the
    Evidence spreadsheet collated by the UK Parliament Digital Service.
    The additional data entity types allow each identified <strong>competency</strong>
    to be linked to zero or more <strong>features</strong> of the Register of
    Members' Interest.
    These <strong>features</strong> are derived from current or potential attributes of the register.
    An attribute in this instance is very broad, and could include not only whether
    or not data is collected, but also whether it is structured, validated, linked
    or of a sufficient quality.
    <strong>States</strong> make <strong>features</strong> available (or by omission,
    not available). The fundamental question this tool can answer is
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For a givenstate, is a question...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            answerable - all required features are available in the relative state
        </li>
        <li>
            unanswerable - not all required features are available in the
            relative state
        </li>
        <li>
            unaskable - there are no features that exist in this state or any
            other which could answer this question
        </li>
    </ul>
